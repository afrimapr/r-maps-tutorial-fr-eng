Welcome to the afrimapr tutorial : Entry level R maps from African data.
========================================================================

This repository contains materials in French & English to support a 4 hour + tutorial that can be led or self guided.

It was initially delivered at the useR2021 conference.

It is structured as an RStudio project.

To get started
