# Welcome to the afrimapr tutorial : Entry level R maps from African data.


This repository contains materials in French & English to support a 4 hour + tutorial that can be led or self guided.

It was initially delivered at the useR2021 conference.

It is structured as an RStudio project.

The tutorial is divided into 3 sessions, each can take around 90 minutes. The final session is a practical that gives you some pointers to applying the material from the first two sessions on data of your own choice.


## To use the tutorial resources


### 1. copy the project to your local machine

From RStudio select File, New project, From version control, & paste in the address of this repository. That should create a copy on your local machine.


### 2. run code to install packages

On your local machine, in RStudio, open the file **packages_and_data.R**. Press **Source** to run the whole file, this should install all the packages that you need for the tutorial.


### 3. choose French or English

In RStudio, open the folder for **english** or **french**


### 4. run code to disply tutorial text and images

In RStudio, open the **for_learners** folder and open the file **1_tutorial_code_session_one.R** and run the first two lines of code. This should open a html document in the RStudio **Viewer** tab with text, images and code for the tutorial.


### 5. read text in the Viewer tab, run code in the Console

Read gradually through the tutorial in the **Viewer** tab. When you come to code sections you can copy & paste code into the R console to run it yourself and experiment with modifying. Static plots will appear in the RStudio Plots tab and you can click on the Viewer tab to return to the tutorial text. Dynamic plots (e.g. from tmap & mapview) will appear in the Viewer tab and you can press the back arrow to return to the tutorial text.

The R file **1_tutorial_code_session_one.R**, that you accessed before, contains just the code sections of the tutorial so you can also use this to copy & paste code into the console.

In the 'for_learners' folder, each session has an R script - these contain all the code you will need to run through the tutorial. 


### 6. repeat for sessions 2 & 3



### Extra information

The `session_info.txt` file in the project folder contains the packages and package versions used in this tutorial.

The 'data' folder contains data to use for the practical part of the tutorial in session three if you have not brought your own data.
